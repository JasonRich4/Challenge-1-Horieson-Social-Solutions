# Challenge #1 - Horieson: Social Solutions

## Description

The purpose of this repository and challenge was to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and deployment. Not only on a developmental facet, but as well as a reconstructive and concise. I was given a set of codes that I had to simplify and improve through my knowledge of coding and web development. This was a good training experience to learn how to analyze code and how and where to make improvements effectively. This taught me comprehension, adaptiveness, as well as confidence as a web developer.
